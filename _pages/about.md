I am a neuroscientist interested in visual perception of objects. Iâ€™m currently pursuing a research question of how ongoing brain states influence neural processing of incoming visual information and subsequent object perception.  To study this question I use human fMRI, MEG, ECoG, eye-tracking, psychophysics, and computational tools.
  
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Neuroscience Institute, New York University in the lab of Biyu J. He.
